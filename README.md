HARX - HTML-annotated rendering extension
=========================================

HARX is a PHP 7.2 written HTML-annotated rendering and templating extension, based on PageKit's
[Razr](https://github.com/pagekit/razr) engine whose syntax was inspired by ASP.NET's Razor. Harx
contains the basic, still sightly changed, syntax from Razr and extends the environment with `<custom />`
HTML tags to make it easier to embed several identical elements.


Features
--------

-   Set, Get, Print and Work with **Variables** and **Constants**
-   Use **Conditional** Control Structures (`@if`, `@elif`, `@endif`)
-   Use **Loops** (`@each`, `@endeach`, `@for`, `@endfor`, `@while`, `@endwhile`)
-   Define Parts (`@part`, `@endpart`) and Blocks (`@block`, `@enblock`) of Code
-   Directly **Include** (`@include`), **Extend** (`@extend`) or **Embed** (`@embed`) Content
-   Register `<custom />` HTML tags, which gets rendered using your callback function
-   **Caches everything** up to improve the performance and speed


### Differences to pagekit/razr

-   Requires PHP 7.2.x, Tested up To PHP 7.4.6
-   The `<custom />` HTML tags has been added
-   The `@elseif` directive has been replaced with `@elif`
-   The `@foreach` directive has been replaced with `@each`
-   The `@for` directive has been added
-   The `@continue` and `@break` Loop directives has been added
-   The `@embed` directive has been added
-   The `@part` directive has been added
-   A new configuration structure and environment
-   A new caching system
-   A new `Larx` called single-file drop-in library
-   And a few more changes... View the CHANGELOG.md file for more...


Versions
--------

The HARX extension contains 2 different versions:

- **Harx** - `Harx\Harx`
- **Larx** -`Larx\Larx`

HARX contains the whole environment and functionallity, provided by this library, while Larx is a
single-file drop-in version which is perfectly capable for really small projects or even plugins.
Of course, both support the whole HARX syntax as described on the [documentation](https://harx.io/docs).

### Differences

Larx ...

-   ... doesn't contain custom Exceptions
-   ... doesn't contain the Loader interfaces
-   ... use a smaller caching system ...
-   ... and doesn't cache per default
-   ... is build within one class
-   ... offers just a bunch of public methods


Requirements
------------

The HARX library just requires **PHP 7.2.0** (or above), no dependencies.


Performance
-----------

The Harx library is build for speed and tries, at least, to be faster than Twig and Blade, while
still offering an extensive environment, providing a small single-file drop-in version called Larx.
Check out the Performance Table below, more information can be found on [harx.io/performance](https://harx.io/performance).


Basic Usage
-----------

As you may have seen, we'are using the `.xhtml` extension instead of `.razr` to allow the basic
HTML syntax working on your favourite Editor and IDE, but the files are - of course - not valid
XHTML files at all. We're working on additional extensions for ATOM and Visual Studio Code to
support the future used `.hxht` (**h**ar**x** **ht**ml) extension.

Below you will find just a basic PHP implementation, check out the [official documentation](https://harx.io/docs)
for more information and instructions.

```php
<?php
    // Create a new Instance
    $harx = new Harx\Harx([
        "cache" => true
    ]);

    // Create Variables
    $array = [
        "variable"  => 12
    ];

    // Create Classes
    $article = new Article(1);

    // Render your file, Pass the variables you need
    $harx->render("./index.xhtml", [
        "name"      => "My Name",
        "data"      => $array,
        "article"   => $article
    ]);
```
